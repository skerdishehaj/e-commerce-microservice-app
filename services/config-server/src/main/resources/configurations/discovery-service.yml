  # This comment addresses a common issue with Eureka where instances may be incorrectly marked as up.
  # The renewalPercentThreshold is set to 0.85 to ensure that at least 85% of the expected heartbeats are received before considering an instance as down.
  # Avoid 'EMERGENCY! EUREKA MAY BE INCORRECTLY CLAIMING INSTANCES ARE UP WHEN THEY'RE NOT. RENEWALS ARE LESSER THAN THRESHOLD AND HENCE THE INSTANCES ARE NOT BEING EXPIRED JUST TO BE SAFE'
